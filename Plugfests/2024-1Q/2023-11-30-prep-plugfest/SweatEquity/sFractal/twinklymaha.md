# TwinklyMaHa

## Intent for 30-Nov-2023
Dev and [production](https://twinklymaha-prod-q353uyxfhq-uk.a.run.app/twinkly)
mqtt twinklies are working as of 5-Nov-23 
but on quirky domains. 
Intent to have the twinkly domain by Prep2. 
Prep1 in Nov will still be on quirky domains.

Current (Nov2023) twinkly (v0.11.2) has [SBOMs](https://twinklymaha-prod-q353uyxfhq-uk.a.run.app/.well-known/sbom).
As of 5-Nov only has MQTT 3 for OpenC2 API.
As of 5-Nov has outdated SBOM queries.
Hope is to have updated queries by 30-Nov for interworking with other projects.

Desire to have MQTT5 by 30-Nov but stretch (need to redo dependencies - am looking at two alternative libraries from one currently used).

As of 5-Nov, only has older CDX and SPDX versions. Unlikely to fix by 30-Nov but plan to fix by Prep2

As of 5-Nov, doesn't have a vex (although capable). Hope to have log4j/no-component VEX by 30-Nov.


## Intent for Prep2 in Feb-2024
Hoping to have everything ready for Village in March. 
Will update nearer to Feb if not the case.

Current (Nov2023) QBQ is MQTT 3. 
Plan to have MQTT 5 by Feb.

Current (Nov2023) QBQ isn't yet updated with all the categories of Village.
Plan to have MQTT 5 by Feb.
