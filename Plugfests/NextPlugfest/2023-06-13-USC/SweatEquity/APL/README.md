# APL - IOB  Sweat Equity

# 1. About APL

Johns Hopkins APL is a not-for-profit university affiliated research center (UARC) that solves complex research, engineering, and analytical problems that present critical challenges to our nation.

Our scientists, engineers, and analysts serve as trusted advisors and technical experts to the government, ensuring the reliability of complex technologies that safeguard our nationâ€™s security and advance the frontiers of space. We also maintain independent research and development programs that pioneer and explore emerging technologies and concepts to address future national priorities.

Please see [our website](https://www.jhuapl.edu) for more information.

# 2. Attendance

APL intends to have at least one participant from the IOB project available during the plugfest.

# 3. Use Case Sweat Equity Metric

See [Use Case Sweat Equity](../UseCases/use_case_tech.md) for explanation
of relating organizaiton's sweat equity to
Technologies / Standards / Open Source Projects to which "days" in
the [use case](../UseCases/README.md).

# 4. Contributions

IOB will provide a reference implementation Javascript Object Notation (JSON) for IOB representation of the relevant Use Case(s) used in the event. IOB may also use a publicly available python script to convert IOB bundles into Neo4J graph database and provide queries.

# 5. Planned Technologies

## 5.1 Machine to Machine

IOB behavior bundle JSON and python converter script available at [this github link](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/oca-iob/tree/main/STIX2NEO4J%20Converter).

## 5.2 Human to Machine

IOB will provide Neo4J the following graph database queries

```
// Sample Neo4J queries assuming the script was used with a "bundlesource" named CASPDEMO

// See the Behavior Set
MATCH(A) WHERE A.bundlesource="CASPDEMO" RETURN A

// Show the Detection Relationships (requires APOC enabled on Neo4j)
MATCH (A)-[r:detects]->(B:`x-oca-behavior`) 
WHERE A.bundlesource="CASPDEMO" 
Return A.name as DetectionName, apoc.convert.fromJsonMap(A.analytic).type as AnalyticType, apoc.text.base64Decode(apoc.convert.fromJsonMap(A.analytic).rule) as AnalyticRule, type(r) , B.name as BehaviorName, B.technique as BehaviorTechnique
ORDER BY BehaviorName

// Show the Kestrel Huntbook (requires APOC enabled)
MATCH(A) WHERE A.bundlesource="CASPDEMO" 
UNWIND apoc.convert.fromJsonList(A.correlation_workflows) AS WFDATA
RETURN A.name, A.description, WFDATA.type as Corr_Type, WFDATA.note as Corr_Note, 
apoc.text.base64Decode(WFDATA.workflow) as Corr_Workflow

//Show the CACAO Playbook Data (Requires APOC enabled on NEo4j)
MATCH (A:`x-oca-playbook`)-[r]->(B:`course-of-action`) 
WHERE A.bundlesource="CASPDEMO" 
RETURN A.name,A.playbook_type,A.playbook_format,
apoc.text.base64Decode(A.playbook_bin),type(r),B.name

```

# 6. Planned Use Cases

IOB plans to support use cases based on the planned Kestrel Huntbooks for use in the event.
