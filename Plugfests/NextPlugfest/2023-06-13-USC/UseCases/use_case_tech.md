# Use Case Technologies / Standards / Open Source Projects

This page is a companion page to [Demo Use Cases](./README.md).
It contains a brief summary of the project involved,
how it fits into the use case,
and provices links to supporting information
(e.g. STIX bundles, CACAO playbooks, OpenC2 commands, ...)
and to the organizations interworking with them in
[sweat equity](../SweatEquity/README.md).

They are listed ordered by amount of sweat equity,
evaluated subjectively using:
```
N = (3*X) + (2*Y) + Z
```
where:
- X = number of organizations providing working software machine-to-machine API's using this technology. For example sFractal's TwinklyMaHa interfaces MQTT/OpenC2 with the DKI MQTT broker which in turn interfaces MQTT/OpenC2 with the HII OIF project. These interfaces can be used to demo OpenC2 use in the Day 1,2,3,4 use cases. This would result in X=3 (sFractal, HII, NSA).
- Y = similar to X, but instead of machine-to-machine, there is human-to-machine interface. For example, certain vendors may demo products that don't have standard interfaces but can show value to the use case by allowing village participants to use the human interface to their technology
- Z = similar to X but [hand-waving lycan](../faq.md#what-is-the-handwaving-lycan) is involved

## OpenC2 =9

### What is OpenC2?
OpenC2 is a standardized language for the command and control of technologies 
that provide or support cyber defenses. 
By providing a common language for machine-to-machine communication, 
OpenC2 is vendor and application agnostic, 
enabling interoperability across a range of cyber security tools and applications.
The use of standardized interfaces and protocols 
enables interoperability of different tools, 
regardless of the vendor that developed them, 
the language they are written in or the function they are designed to fulfill.
