10:30-4 pacific

No keynotes because:
- some members requested no keynotes
- too short notice
- no time

Village is scheduled to start at 10:30 Pacific 
but note that we do not get access to the room
until 10:30 so there might be a delay.

A lunch break is planned, but time/duration 
is dependent on if a sponsor is found.

Focus is on demoable code and working products,
some time will be spent on use case development
and stragegy for projects working together in future.
