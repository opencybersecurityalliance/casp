10:30-4 pacific

No keynotes because:
- some members requested no keynotes
- too short notice
- no time

Village is scheduled to start at 10:30 Pacific 
but note that we do not get access to the room
until 10:30 so there might be a delay.

A lunch break is planned, but lunch will not be brought in.
Participants are on their own.
We will have directions to local eateries on site.

Focus is on demoable code and working products,
some time will be spent on use case development
and stragegy for projects working together in future.
