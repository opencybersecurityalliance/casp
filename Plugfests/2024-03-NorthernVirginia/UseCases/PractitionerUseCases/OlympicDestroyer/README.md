# Olympic Destroyer

  #Day 1 / Opening Ceremonies

  On February 9, 2018, as the opening ceremonies for the Pyeongchang Winter
  Olympics commenced, a long-plotted exploit suddenly compromised much
  of the infrastructure supporting the games. 

  Initial complaints about wi-fi and ticketing snafus were but the first 
  symptoms of a deeper illness that compromised the organiing committee's 
  entire network. 

  Quick work executed expertly over a tense night brought down a wide range of
  physical and digital assets ranging from networked televisions and internet
  service to vital venue components and facility support elements. 

  The official Olympic website and ticketing app had to be taken offline along 
  with every individual computer and server on the Olympic-built network. Ultimately,
  the culprit--a script known only as "winlogon.exe"--was isolated and the network restored.

  Long after the games concluded, Korean officials working in concert with American
  and British cybersecurity experts identified the signature of Russian GRU hackers.
  A sophisticated spearphishing campaign administered months prior to the opening ceremony
  laid the groundwork for the sudden and devastating act.

  Though the games continued thanks to the hard work and fine-honed expertise
  of the Olympics' IT and cybersecurity support personnel, the long-term
  effects were a psychological shot across the bow. Physical infrastructure
  has become intertwined and indistinguishable from digital infrastructure.
  The security of one is paramount to the other. 

  More importantly, a legacy event premised on international good will and
  the fostering of universal sportsmanship through shared public space
  was still not sacred enough to merit the respect of motivated black 
  hat hackers.
