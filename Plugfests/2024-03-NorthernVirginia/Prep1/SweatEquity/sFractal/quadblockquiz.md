# Quad Block Quiz
## Intent for 30-Nov-2023
Dev and production (https://quadquiz-q353uyxfhq-uk.a.run.app/) games are working as of 5-Nov-23 but on quirky domains. Intent to have the quadblockquiz domain by Prep2. 
Prep1 in Nov will still be on quirky domains.

Note won't be playable until I turn on on 30-Nov. 
See me if someone wants early access for either sponsor or Q&A reasons.

Current (Nov2023) QBQ (v0.28.1) has SBOMs (https://quadquiz-q353uyxfhq-uk.a.run.app/.well-known/sbom) but does not have MQTT (or https) OpenC2 interfaces for SBOM query. Intent to have by Prep2.

Contest text is old from a previous corporate event.
May be updated by 30-Nov (at least on dev version).
