# Sekoia


## STIX example
Sekoia CTI database is based on STIX.
We can bring several STIX bundles on CTI related Usecases.
A direct ingestion in OpenCTI can also be presented.


## Project-centric Interfaces
### OXA

* Explain that a SOC platform / XDR/ SIEM has to interconnect in different manners with technologies
 - Show how it has to integrate events from technology vendors (links with ECS, OHDF, OCSF)
 - Show how it has to orchestrate response strategies with playbooks (links with CACAO)
 - Show how it can propose automated actions (links with OpenC2)
 - Show how it can leverage CTI for detection activities (link with STIX/TAXII)

* Explain that these jobs could be made easier if an architecture would allow to have basic rules for each in terms of interaction final_technology(ie EDR) <-> analytic_technology (ie SIEM)


## Use Case Support
- Support the OlympicDestroyer usecase by providing STIX bundles that can describe CTI objects
