# Announcement

The next CASP event will be 
a 2-day Cybersecurity Automation Village in Virginia in April,2024.
For more info, see [Next Village](Plugfests/2024-03-NorthernVirginia/README.md)
and participate in the [CASP mailing list](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oca-casp).

The most recent plugfest was held at USC in June, 2023. 
See [USC Plugfest](Plugfests/2023-06-13-USC/README.md)
for more details.

### Test Planning

Because plugfests exercise interworking among independent implementations, it's helpful for
participants to register interest in testing specific protocols with other participants.
If you are considering participating, please use the CASP mailing list or GitHub issue to request
to be added to the [test matrix](Plugfests/2024-03-NorthernVirginia/test-matrix-2024-03.md),
or edit it directly and submit a GitHub pull request.

# OCA CASP Sub-project
The [Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA)](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/) 
Cybersecurity Automation SubProject (CASP) is composed of like-minded global cybersecurity vendors, end users, thought leaders and individuals who are interested in cybersecurity automation.

It is a forum where vendors, researchers, and software publishers can freely exchange product information, insights, and reference implementations via commonly developed code and tooling, using mutually agreed upon technologies, specifications, and procedures.

OCA is an [OASIS Open Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org/). 
For more information on OCA, 
see [https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/).

For more information on CASP, see:
- CASP's OCA page at [https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/CASP](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/CASP),
- CASP's [Cybersecurity Automation Village](https://www.cybersecurityautomationvillage.org/),
- CASP's organizational page at https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oca-casp which includes mailing list archives and how to join the mailing list.
