# OCA CASP Sub-project
The [Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA)](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/) 
Cybersecurity Automation SubProject (CASP) is composed of like-minded global cybersecurity vendors, end users, thought leaders and individuals who are interested in cybersecurity automation.

It is a forum where vendors, researchers, and software publishers can freely exchange product information, insights, and reference implementations via commonly developed code and tooling, using mutually agreed upon technologies, specifications, and procedures.

OCA is an [OASIS Open Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org/). 
For more information on OCA, 
see [https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/).

For more information on CASP, see:
- CASP's OCA page at [https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/CASP](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/CASP),
- CASP's [Cybersecurity Automation Village](https://www.cybersecurityautomationvillage.org/),
- CASP's organizational page at https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oca-casp which includes mailing list archives and how to join the mailing list.
